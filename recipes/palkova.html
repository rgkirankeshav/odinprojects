<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Palkova is a milk sweet made by simmering, thickening and reducing milk until thick then sugar,cardamom powder and ghee are added for flavoring.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Cardamom</li>
    <li>Ghee</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Use a heavy bottomed vessel for making palkova so that it doesn't burn easily at the bottom. Also make sure to wet the base of the  vessel before pouring milk. I used heavy bottomed bronze uruli. Add milk to it.</li>
    <li>Keep the flame in low medium but take care to stir often. This is after almost 1 hour. Milk is reduced to almost 1/4th and is thick.</li>
    <li>At this stage add sugar and cardamom powder</li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon ghee. Give a quick mix.</li>
    <li>Mix well, it will leaves the sides of the pan but still gooey. Switch off at this stage, after it cools down it may get more thicker. Enjoy Palkova!</li>
